MindPeace: Thanks for sharing, Leo. I’m here to support you. What feels most important to talk about right now regarding your social anxiety?

Leo: Lately the social anxiety has been hard to describe, I don't know what to do.

MindPeace: I appreciate your honesty, Leo. It's a lot to carry—acknowledging it is already a strong first step. We can try a calm breathing pattern: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6, repeat 5 times. I'm happy to check in on how it went and adjust together. Thanks for telling me: "Lately the social anxiety has been hard to describe, I don't know what to do."

Leo: I feel a bit better hearing this.
